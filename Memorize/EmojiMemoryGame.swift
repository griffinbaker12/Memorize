// this ViewModel is specific for Emoji Memory games
// the ViewModel is part of the UI (packaging up the model for the UI, so it has to know what the UI looks like); it won't be creating views or anything like that
import SwiftUI

// want to list the super class before the other things that you behave like
class EmojiMemoryGame: ObservableObject {
    // its whole job in a way is to understand the Model and talk to it and interpret the data and present it to the View in a really nice way
    // you can add `private` to make the sepation full b/c otherwise the view could directly edit the model
//    private var model = MemoryGame(
//        numberOfPairsOfCards: 4
//    ) {
//        return ["👻", "🎃", "🕷️", "😈", "🧛", "👽", "🤖", "🧟", "💀", "👹", "🕹️", "🪩"][$0]
//    }

    // make emojis global, but namespace it inside of the class and then make it private so only we can use it!
    // globals get initialized first, so

    // order properties are initialized is undetermined and not in the order of source

    // return types always have to be explicit, cannot be inferred in Swift
    // wouldn't actually call it this, but is just for pedagogical purposes
